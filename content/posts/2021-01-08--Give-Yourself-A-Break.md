You don’t have to be on “go” all the time.

Today, for all the hard work I did all week, I rewarded myself with 2 bagel sandwiches (in addition to my [daily sweetgreen salad](https://antdke.co/posts/eat-your-greens)).

- 1 whole wheat everything with egg & cheese + onions
- 1 whole wheat everything with vegetable tofu

They was _delicious_.

My todo list for today doesn’t consist of any “work” work.

I’m actually on my way to Best Buy to get a controller so I can play Apple Arcade games on my iPad.
