It’s the first thing visitors see when they come to your site.

If your landing page hero is _unclear_, _uninteresting_, or _irrelevant_, visitors bounce.

In those first few seconds, they asses:

- What you do

- Whether you’re right for them

Here are a few ways you can improve it and keep visitors on your site.

## Header

In your header, you need to state **the value you provide**.

A way to do this is to state how your product solves their problem better than competitors or no solution at all.

Then you add a hook: Something that wows OR something that addresses an objection.

<br />

## Subheader

Here, you state what your product does _exactly_.

Expand on what you wrote in your header —how does it work?

Talk about your top 1-2 features. And keep it brief.

## CTA

CTAs continue the narrative you’ve laid out in your header & subheader.

Keep it contextual and relevant. (ie. “Get Started” is generic).

## Design

A few tips on design:

- Keep it straightforward —People are there for the product not your landing page transitions and animations.

- Show the product in action —Use a GIF or video showing the core use-case of your product.

- Show off that others use it —Adding pictures of people enjoying your product and other social proof doesn’t hurt.
