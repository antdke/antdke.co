I felt like taking a walk today.

I opened Google Maps and looked up "breakfast" and chose this nearby diner called Penelope.

Then I walked.

Walking through New York is the greatest because I know there's so much going on. So many stories happening at the same time. So many books being written.

**Side note:** If you want great "walking through a city" music, I recommend The Dip's 4-song EP, _Won't Be Coming Back_. I guarantee an energizing, jazzy montage. ðŸŽ·âœ¨

## Blueberry Pancakes

After my walking montage, I arrived at Penelope's outdoor seating camp site.

Yes, it was cold out, but the pancakes warmed me out.

I haven't had blueberry pancakes in years.

They were delicious.

**Funny end story:** At Penelope, a womanâ€™s tiny dog jumped out of its bag and ran off.

She chased it down the sidewalk. But, tiny dog outpaced her.

Luckily, a guy in a yellow coat was ahead. He squatted and recovered the dog like a fumbled football.

_Thanks for reading :)_
