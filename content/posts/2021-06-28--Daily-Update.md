I got a personal trainer at Equinox today.

I bought a trainer package where we do 1 session together a week for 6 weeks and then he prescribes workout for 2 other days in the week.

My goal is to sculpt my upper-body to make it more aesthetic â€” abs, rounder shoulders, bigger biceps, [the whole shebang](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20whole%20shebang).

We'll see where I'm at in 6 weeks :)
