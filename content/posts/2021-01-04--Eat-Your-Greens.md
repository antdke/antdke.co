My girlfriend is gluten-free & vegan.

Which means she only eats leaves and ice.

Me, I’m not so picky.

But, I have noticed how different I feel when I eat healthy foods vs not. There's a big differece in how I perform in my work.

When I don't eat right, I'm sluggish and tired and can't think well.

When I eat right, I'm full of energy and my mind is crystal-clear.

## Mental Clarity

Even though I’m not longer a physical athlete (I played varsity football & basketball in high school), I’m a mental athlete. So I still need to be on top of my game.

I need to be able to make the right decisions day in and day out. Especially, if I want to get to generational wealth.

In an era where every individual can start their own media company (YouTube, TikTok, etc) or build their own tech product (AWS, Github, etc), everyone has access to similar opportunities.

This means that best way to get ahead (besides having \$ and connections) is [having good judgment](https://nav.al/judgment) and making better decisions than everyone else.

And the way to make better decisions is to have mental clarity.

## Eating My Greens

So I'm going to start eating more greens.

Today, my breakfast was a salad from sweetgreen. I'll also have one for dinner.

I'm thinking to do this everyday. Along with some fruits, baked potato, and greek yogurt.

A great book worth skimming is _[How Not To Die](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/)_ by Michael Greger and Gene Stone.

The first half of the book talks about what to eat to prevent dying from the leading causes of death, like heart disease. The second half of the book talks about healthy foods you should eat everyday.

It was pretty eye-opening.

Anyway, it's 5pm in New York and I should probably go out to get my second sweetgreen bowl.

Moral of the story: _Eat your greens_.
