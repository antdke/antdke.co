# Voltron Assemble

I met [Gabe](https://twitter.com/gabe_ragland) in a Product Hunt discussion thread.

Aaron from Product Hunt sent out an email about signing up to submit a product to their ["WFH Maker Festival"](https://www.producthunt.com/makers-festival/wfh). I grew a habit of reading their daily emails so I trusted that this email would be interesting too.

I sign up and check out the discussion thread that was meant for sharing ideas and teammate hunting.

I had been a solopreneur for the past several months. I was tired of it. I wanted to be a part of a team.

I see Gabe's discussion post. And he's looking to do something similar.

[Gabe's post]

So I slide into the comments and shoot my shot

[my comment]

He was DTF(B) —_Down to Fuckin' Build_.

[Gabe saying yes]

Valentin joined a few days later.

I had tweeted out that I was looking for teammates for the "Floom" idea. He saw that and DM'd me. I send the Slack invite his way.

Gametime.

# Building Montage

Our stack:

- React.js
- [Daily.co](https://daily.co/)
- [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) + [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (for styling)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ([Zeit](https://vercel.com/), now renamed to Vercol, for hosting)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (for database + auth)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (for design stuffs)
- [Notion](https://notion.so) (for docs, notes, to-do's)

Gabe made a React boilerplate builder called [Divjoy](https://divjoy.com/) that creates an entire codebase with React + a UI kit + Firebase + a hosting service with a click of a button.

We dogfooded Divjoy. We only had 2 weeks until the submission deadline for the Maker Festival. It saved us a ton of time.

# Imposter Syndrome

Initially, I was intimidated. I had never worked with teammates so technically skilled.

I mean, I know how to code. I made this site that you're reading this blog post on. I can build shit. But these guys are next level.

I'd be like, "Alright so the focus is X. So it would make sense if we have feature Y."

Then they'd like, "Got it", :thumbs-up:, and the feature is done within the hour.

For a while, all I could do was sit in awe and go "Dude, you're a ninja." :fire:

Felt like the dumbest person in the ~~room~~ Slack channel.

But eventually, I got over that feeling. Because I realized that how I _should_ feel. Being a part of a _good_ team should make you feel like you have to push yourself. Being a part of a team sharpens you. It highlights what you're good at and exposed what you can improve on. From that point on, I was over the fantasy of being a "superstar solopreneur." Doing it solo is cool, but having teammates is much better.

# That’s All Folks

Chatparty is a weird toy that we built for Product Hunt’s WFH Maker Festival.

We built and shipped it in 15 days.

And now that this launch is done, reality is settling in: We’ve built a video communication app in a time where the demand for video apps is sky high.

This “new normal” era is pregnant with opportunity.

So the question now is, “what will we pivot to?”

Stay tuned.
