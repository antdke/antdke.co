A big reason why [I write everyday](https://antdke.co/posts/2021-goal-write-everyday) is because of physics.

Newton’s [first law](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-1/Newton-s-First-Law) states: “An object in motion, stays in motion.”

Writing puts me in motion:

- I’m constantly thinking
- I’m learning new ideas
- I’m solidifying old ideas
- I’m sharpening my writing skills
- I’m improving my storytelling
- I’m sharing my writing with the world
- I’m getting responses from readers
- I’m building an audience

All these things propel me towards a better version of myself.

And as long as I keep doing it, I stay on that trajectory of improvement.

Compounding.

## Stay in motion

My advice for you is to do the same:

Find something that puts you in motion (on a trajectory for self-improvement)

- Exercise
- Reading
- Coding
- Painting
- Etc.

Then, stay in motion.

Watch where you’ll be in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years.
