I've been thinking about [this tweet](https://twitter.com/blhack/status/1350545474667778048) for the past 24 hours.

It reminded me of myself, before I realized what I wanted to do with my life.\*

I was always a hard worker. I would generate my own luck through action.

But before I had direction, it was hard for me to know _why_ I was working hard.

I would have lucky opportunities come my way, from my actions, but I was never 100% sure what to do with.

It was often:

- _"This opportunity looks cool!"_
- _"But this one looks cool too."_
- _"Ooo, what about this one?"_

It wasn't until I picked a direction that I could differentiate between an opportunities that were "right for me" and ones that were okay but decline-able.

It's advice I'd give to any young person.

Pick a direction and you'll quickly discover where your energy should be devoted to and where it doesn't.

You'll find out which winds are favorable or not.
