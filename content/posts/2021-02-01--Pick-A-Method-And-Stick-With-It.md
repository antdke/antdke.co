Practicing code is like practicing basketball.

- There are a dozen ways to dribble a ball.

- There are a dozen ways to create a database.

- There are a dozen ways to shoot a jumpshot.

- There are a dozen ways to create a website.

In the end, you have to pick a method and just stick with it.

Then, just keep doing that method until it becomes second nature.

And boom, you’re one step closer to becoming great.

## it used to trip me up

This is something that used to trip me up when I was just starting to learn code.

I convinced myself that there was no way that I would memorize all these different methods and functions _and_ be able to just whip them out when I need them.

Now, I realize you don’t need _all_ the different methods and functions for a particular situation.

You just need one method that solves that specific problem well, and you just use it every time you encounter that problem.

- _Oh, I have to delete an element from a list?_ → Cool, I’ll just use “.pop()” like I always do.

* _Oh, I have to create a landing page?_ → Cool, I’ll just use an HTML + Tailwind CSS template because I know them like the back of my hand.

* _Oh, I have to get past this defender?_ → Cool, I’ll just do a quick hesitation dribble and use my speed to blow past them, like I always do.

* _Oh, I have to shoot over this defender at the wing?_ → Cool, I’ll just do a one dribble pull up because I know how to do it well.

You don’t need to know every method and possible solution for a specific situation. Most of the time, that one method you’ve used countless times before will do the job just fine.
