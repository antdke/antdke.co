Few people have <span style="color:brown">**a lot**.</span>

A lot of people have <span style="color:brown">**a little**.</span>

Most people have <span style="color:brown">**nothing**.</span>

In fact, most people have <span style="color:brown">**so much nothing**</span>, that the nothing turns into a human named "Nothing" and starts charging people for his time.

So Nothing has _something_. Most people have [less than Nothing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/14/parasite-paints-nightmarish-picture-korean-inequality-reality-america-is-even-worse/).

## Family

I don't know exactly how much my family is <span style="color:gold">**worth.**</span>

When asked, I'd just say I'm (lower) middle class. I never asked my parents. I just 'got it' from context clues.

**For context:**
My mom immigrated (with me) to the US from Nigeria in 2001 for work.
We live in the South Bronx. My parents argue a lot; mostly over nothing. My dad has [high blood pressure](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-finances/money-troubles-tied-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease-for-african-americans-idUSKCN1Q41UV) and diabetes (can't remember which type). And according to her doctor, my mom's stress levels are so high, [certain foods](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2013/could-a-hidden-allergy-be-causing-your-migraines/) now give her migraines. No more rice or bread.

Given these context clues, I could tell that we aren't exactly "financially comfortable".

I went to a private all-boys high school, for free. I got into New York University, essentially for free. The only loans I take out are to get the full experience of living in the city. But that's only about \$2,000 every 3-4 months.

## Cue the Violins

This blog post isn't meant to be a sob story. It's a <span style="color:red">**fire starter.**</span>

This is a motivational speech to myself that I'm sharing with you.

Looking at the history of wealth from a macro-perspective, being poor has a [bleak outlook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States). Being poor and black [even worse](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/).

Now, I'm not one to let my circumstances define or label me, but numbers in aggregate don't lie.

## Resolve

You and I, and I say _you and I_ because chances are we're in the [bottom 50](https://wid.world/country/usa/) together, are either on the cusp of dying or we're already dead. Social death I mean. Economic death as well.

So, what are we going to do to ~~survive~~ thrive?

The answer is quite simple. <span style ="color:green">**We make money**</span>

or we die.
