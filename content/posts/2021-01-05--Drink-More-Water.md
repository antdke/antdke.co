Two days ago, I watched the [Y-Combinator talk](https://youtu.be/LH1bewTg-P4) titled "How to Win", given by Daniel Gross.

In it, he talks about the ways founders should prepare mentally, physically, and emotionally to grow their startup.

There's a part where he recommends drinking "100 oz" of water a day.

I've always been a fan of drinking lots of water daily ([huge health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-health-benefits-of-water)) but I never put a number to how much I should drink. 100 oz sounds doable.

I know I'll have to pee a lot though.

The price of being hydrated.

(I use this 20.3 oz reusable bottle. So I'll only need 5 bottles a day.)
