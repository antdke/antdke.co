Pat Walls' [blog](https://patwalls.com/this-new-blog) inspired me. I'll write daily starting today.

## The first blog starts below:

Lots of courses are being made.

Since course making is so much more accessible nowadays, there‚Äôs probably a saturation. This means that there‚Äôs possibly less money being concentrated to a few people. That means at one point there was. I wonder how much money early course creators like [patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11) or [wesbos](https://wesbos.com/) made. I know the [refactoring UI guys](https://marketingexamples.com/misc/refactoring-ui) made a fortune. I wonder if those ‚Äúgolden days‚Äù are over? ü§î

I thinking about this stuff because I want to create a course. (More on that later)
