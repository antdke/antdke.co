I listened the latest episode of [The Founder's Journal](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-founders-journal/id1509276485) by [Alex Lieberman](https://twitter.com/businessbarista) (Morning Brew's CEO).

It's about audience building.

It's like a 15 min episode. And it's filled with gems. But the key insight that stuck out to me is this:

He says that an audience for an individual is looking towards that individual to fill a need.

And that made me ask myself: **_What need am I filling for my audience?_**

That question made me rethink how I'm approaching [my newsletter](https://theproductperson.com).

New issue _and_ Twitter thread coming out tomorrow morning.

Stay tuned ;P

(Here's the episode btw)
