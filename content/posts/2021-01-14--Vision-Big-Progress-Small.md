The other day, I got frustrated.

"This is taking too long," I thought.

I backed away from my laptop and exhaled.

Then, the words came to me:

"Vision big, progress small."

## Football analogy

Picture a football field.

The end goal is to get from one side to the other.

In my quest for generational wealth, I have to remind myself that much of the progress I make won't be giant leaps towards the end zone— they'll be more like crawls.

## It's easy to get discouraged

- _"Why aren’t a millionaire yet?"_
- _"Why doesn’t my company have thousands of customers?"_
- _"Why can’t I play Mozart with my eyes closed?"_
- _"Why don’t I have a 6 pack yet?"_

It's classic Buddha: "Desire is suffering."

When you want to make lots of progress really quickly, you're going to be miserable.

## Progress small

You have to let go of the idea that you can magically jump the football field.

All progress will be small and incremental, sometimes invisible. It's only with time that that progress will reveal itself as you look at where you are now and where you've been.

So, keep your vision big and bold.

But, expect your progress to be small and humble.

You won't see the house with only 2 bricks laid. But after 2,000, the house makes itself apparent.
