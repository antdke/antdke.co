In the early days of your business, sales is **more important** than marketing.

Let me tell you why:

## Marketing

Early in your business, you need a **strong signal** for whether youâ€™re solving a problem or not.

With marketing, itâ€™s easy to mistake **false positives for true signals** (ie. likes, retweets, upvotes, site traffic, etc.)

There are so many things that you can feel good about that **arenâ€™t a true signal**.

## Sales

Sales is **binary**: Will they buy your product? _Yes or no?_

The feedback loop is **direct and less open to interpretation**: If someone doesnâ€™t like your product, you experience the rejection live. Ouch

## The Lesson

If your business is young, _talk to every potential user_.

Get on the phone. Go have a coffee (with face-masks). Schedule a Zoom call.

Even if youâ€™re selling a consumer product. You want to know why theyâ€™re even giving you the time of day. And if they donâ€™t like your product, you especially want to know why.

What went wrong? What can you improve/add/remove?

You canâ€™t get that kind of feedback from the dashboard of your favorite marketing analytics tool.
