School starts back up tomorrow.

It'll be the 2nd semester of my senior year at NYU.

I can graduate with confidence because I know what I want to do with my life.\* Plus, I'm [actively saving money](https://antdke.co/posts/money-in-the-bank) from my [day job](https://blissfully.com). And hopefully (fingers crossed) my day job becomes my full-time by the summer.

Two classes I'm excited about:

- A class on modern web development
- A class on database implementations

They'll up my web dev game. Which is a skill I _really_ want to improve. I just need more reps.

If I give myself a project and enough time, I could probably get it down (I got this website running myself). But, since I don't code often it takes more time than someone who codes 3-5 hours a day every weekday.

Similar to how you could (probably) lift a 300 pound weight off the ground even if you don't go to the gym. But if you workout regularly and lift _400 pound_ weights at the gym all the time, then 300 pounds is a piece of cake.

So I'm very excited about these classes.

Fun fact: the modern web dev class is also taught by the [highest rated professor on RateMyProfessor.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1579749).

Admittedly, it's going to difficult to keep this blog up to date. Writing every single day while working, while in school, while working on a side project is [a lot of plates to spin](https://youtu.be/h_wqjY_okek).

I think I can handle it though. I'll have to develop some sort of repeatable system.

Hopefully, it's a smooth-ish ride to graduation.

Pray for me.
