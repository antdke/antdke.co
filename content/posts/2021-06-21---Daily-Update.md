I used Sunday to plan out my week. And I really enjoyed it.

It allowed me to zoom out and ask "what's important that I need/want to get done?"

It's also pretty freeing because it now allows me to relatively run on autopilot throughout the week and not think too much about what I need to do next.

I recommend planning out your weeks on Sunday.

Of course, don't get too married to the plan because [plans can be useless](https://antdke.co/posts/6-15-21#having-a-plan-vs-making-a-plan). But _the act_ of planning is what's important.
