My mom and my sisters drove me into Manhattan to drop me off at my dorm.

While we were there, my youngest sister (8 y/o) got into a little tiff with an older sister (18 y/o) & started sulking and acting grumpy.

Long story short, I eventually had to give my youngest sister a little whack on the head in the middle of the street to get her to act correctly.

And, in that moment: I got a little glimpse into why some parents hit their kids.

Before I go any further, I’m 21. So, farrrr from parenthood. This is a sliver of insight based on my experience as the oldest brother (and having once been a kid myself).

## Kid Psychology

<br />

Kids follow their <span style="color:#5383FC">**impulses.**</span>

They do what _feels_ good **now**.

- Spinach vs Candy → they’ll choose candy.
- Sleep vs Games → they’ll choose games.
- Forgive & Forget vs Sulk & Mope → they’ll choose the latter.

**Kids haven’t developed the muscles to delay gratification.**

And why should they? They’re usually shielded from serious consequences when choosing the immediately gratifying option.

- Touch the hot stove → Mom takes care of it.
- Get a candy tummy ache → Mom gives you medicine.
- Stay up playing Among Us → Take a nap any hour of the day because they're kids.

No (serious) consequences.

## Hacking Kid Psychology

<br />

So how do you get a kid that will always choose the immediately gratifying option to _not_ choose that option and “act like an adult” in the moment?

You have to incentivize them to want to <span style="color:#EBBC00">**behave well.**</span>

Well, how do you do that?

You have to show them that that instantly gratifying option, isn’t so gratifying after all.

You have to show them that that option comes with <span style="color:red">**immediate pain.**</span>

(Sounds a bit harsh, I know. But hear me out.)

You can do that by:

- taking away something (ex: toys)
- giving them something (ex: timeout)
- causing pain (ie. hitting them)

And don't get me wrong, I know _some_ kids might be able to understand pain/consequences “down the road”

Ex:

- Too much candy -> stomach ache
- No sleep -> Tiredness, grumpiness, etc
- Sulking -> Not enjoying life

But from my experience, most young kids are too shortsighted.

In order for them to “get it”, the pain needs to be experienced **as soon as or sooner than the pleasure.**

They need to know that if they do the feel-good option then there might be immediate pleasure, but there’s also <span style="color:red">**immediate pain.**</span>

That way they will be much less likely to choose that option in the moment.

And they’ll be more receptive (even if reluctantly) to acting the “right way.”

Ex:

- Eating their greens
- Getting good sleep
- Forgiving and forgetting

## Will I Hit My Kids?

There's probably plenty of arguments for _not_ hitting your kids. But this post is me reasoning from [first principles](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/) why some parents consider hitting their kids to be an option.

I'm not entirely sure if I'll liberally hit my kids when I have some of my own. But like I said, in the right circumstances, I can see why it makes sense. But it's not a great parenting option.

"Spare the rod and spoil the child" makes a lot more sense now.
