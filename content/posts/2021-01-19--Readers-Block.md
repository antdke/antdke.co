I love when someone voices an idea, that I already believe in, in a way that I haven't thought about before.

It gives me a little high. Because then I get to look at the idea/concept from a fresh perspective.

I got that high today when I watched [this Netflix interview](https://youtu.be/3lT6YfGc-S8) with Chris Rock.

In it, he said: _"I don't believe in writer's block. But I believe there's reader's block. And if you don't read a lot. Then you won't write a lot."_

I 100% agree with this.

## Reader's Block

I entered this year with the [goal to write everyday](https://antdke.co/posts/2021-goal-write-everyday).

So far, so good.

And one thing I’ve noticed is that it’s a lot easier to write when I’m contemplating something that:

- I’ve read in a book
- Or I read on twitter
- Or I experienced that day
- Or I watched in a YouTube video.

Basically, anything I've experienced or consumed.

Consuming ideas/concepts/information into your brain gives you clay to play with and to mold.

Without that clay, you can’t create.

<br />

So what looks like “writer’s block” (a lack stuff to write about) is actually “reader’s block” (a lack of stuff in your brain to pull from).

So, consume more stuff.

- Read (novels, biographies, tweets)
- Watch interviews of brilliant people
- Experience things in life

([Overconsumption](https://antdke.co/posts/create-more-than-you-consume), on the other hand, is a different problem)
