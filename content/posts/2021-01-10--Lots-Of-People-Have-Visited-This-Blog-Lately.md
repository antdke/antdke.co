Someone on Twitter pointed out to me that if you Google “The meaning of the Fish story from Soul” then I’m one of the top results.

In fact, if you just Google "fish story in soul", I'm the #1 result!

(Hey there, 5 people 👋 )

This is pretty cool. I started [writing a blog post everyday](https://antdke.co/posts/2021-goal-write-everyday) in 2021 so that I could get some of my best ideas out of my head and out into the world.

I'm just glad some of my thoughts resonate with so many people :)
