Someone on Twitter pointed out to me that if you Google ‚ÄúThe meaning of the fish story from Soul‚Äù then [my piece](https://antdke.co/posts/pixar-soul) is one of the top results.

In fact, if you just Google "fish story in soul", I'm the #1 result!

(Hey there, 5 people üëã )

This is pretty cool. I started [writing a blog post everyday](https://antdke.co/posts/2021-goal-write-everyday) in 2021 so that I could get some of my best ideas out of my head and out into the world.

I'm just glad some of my thoughts resonate with so many people :)
