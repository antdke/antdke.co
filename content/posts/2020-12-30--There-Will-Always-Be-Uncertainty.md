A big reason why people are afraid to start is because of uncertainty.

- Will people like this?
- Will people buy this?
- What if I’m not good enough?
- When’s the _best_ time to start?
- What are the _best_ tools to use?
- Is the idea validated?
- Is the idea validated _enough_?

There will always be uncertainty.

**The trick is to dive in and reduce the uncertainty yourself.**

You won’t know _for certain_ if you’ll win the basketball game, until you put some shots in the basket and keep the other team off the board.

You won’t know _for certain_ if anyone will buy your product, until you get a few no’s and a few yeses, and ask both people why.

You won’t know _for certain_ if you’ll be able to build the product, until you start and find out what’s difficult about it and what's not so difficult.

**Uncertainty will always exist.**

You get certainty by tackling uncertainty head-on and reducing it yourself.

Once you start, you'll probably find out that what you were unsure about wasn't such a big deal after all.

So whatever it is you’re uncertain about, just do it.
