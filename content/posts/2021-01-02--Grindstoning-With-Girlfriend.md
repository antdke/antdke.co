My girlfriend and I are 5,000 miles apart.

Her family lives in Hawaii. Mine live in New York.

We make it a rule to call/text/Facetime each other every day.

Tonight, we Facetimed and played our favorite Apple Arcade game, [Grindstone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grindstone/id1357426636#web) together.

Well, not "together" but we played on our respective phones while we Facetimed.

It was a fun time.

I wish Facetime had a feature that let you play multiplayer games with each other.

I know, Housparty exists.

But, _another_ app to talk to same person, really?
