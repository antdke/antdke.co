So today I saw that my last [newsletter](https://theproductperson.com) issue was sent to 8 fewer subscribers.

For a second, I felt bad.

For a nanosecond, I legitimately asked myself if I should just “give up” because it could be all “downhill” from here.

Then, I snapped myself out of it because that’s all nonsense.

When else would I even think like this?

- If it were raining, I wouldn’t think it’ll keep raining forever
- If stocks were down one day, I wouldn’t think they’ll just plummet to \$0
- If I bricked one jumpshot, I wouldn’t think I’d never make another shot

So why should I have that thinking here?

Just because a few people unsubscribed, I shouldn’t start fearing that my subscriber count will magically go to 0 soon.

If 5,219 people go missing at once, then there’s a problem lol.

## Think like Jeff Bezos

Just as I shouldn’t feel bad if the numbers go down, I shouldn’t think “I’m the shit” just because my numbers go up.

The problem is allowing the numbers to influence me either way.

My perception of myself should come from myself.

Now I get why [Jeff Bezos never looks at Amazon’s daily stock price](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/jeff-bezos-says-he-doesnt-think-about-amazons-stock-price.html).
