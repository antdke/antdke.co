I recently got an Equinox membership â€” about 2-3 weeks ago.

(I've been wanting to try it out for a long time. And I have a lot saved up so I figured it was worth the cost.)

I got it the same time I got my Apple Watch.

To me, both the Equinox membership and the Apple Watch are symbols that represent the new lengths I'm willing to go to prioritize health and fitness.

An added benefit to my Equinox membership is that each gym through the city doubles as office space for me to work out of.

(I'm currently working at an Equinox as I write this blog post.)

For me, Equinox is a:

- Gym
- Workspace
- Shower
- Place to meet people
- Place to relax and relieve my post-graduation career-anxiety (with their pool, hot tub, and basketball court)

(And I really like the hot tub.)

(Their outdoor pool is nice too.)

(And funny enough, I met [a billionare](https://www.theverge.com/22298001/luminar-austin-russel-ceo-interview-self-driving-cars) there today.)

More on that story in a later blog post.
