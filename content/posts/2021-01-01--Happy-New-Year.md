On New Years Day of 2019, I posted a picture on Instagram.

The caption says:

<blockquote> 
today is the same as yesterday; nothing changes until you make it change —happy new year🎐
</blockquote>

<br />

Although New Years Day is just an arbitrary point in space and time marked January 1st of the year 2021, there's still this "breathe of fresh air" feeling I have towards the new year.

- A fresh start
- A clean slate
- [It's Q1](https://twitter.com/fromedome/status/1344871722227355650?s=20)

There's so much potential for what I can make of it.

(It's also a reminder to get my college exit strategy together, since I graduate in 6 months)

All in all, I can't wait.
