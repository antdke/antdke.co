I get anxious when tasks are unclear.

Especially when I'm unsure where to even start or the steps I'd need to take to get a task done.

I’ve learned that a core part of leadership involves turning <span style="color:brown">**murky water**</span> into <span style="color:lightblue">**crystal clear water**</span>.

It’s removing the clouds from a foggy road.

Providing a flashlight in a dark hallway.

The ability to take an ambigious task, remove the confusion, and communicate the task(s) with clarity to yourself and others is a must-have leadership trait.
