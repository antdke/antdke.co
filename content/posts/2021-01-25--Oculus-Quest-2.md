Today, I got an Oculus Quest 2.

It's a team gift from [my day job](https://blissfully.com).

We're going to be hosting team meetings in VR and having team game competitions.

And I have to say, I'm actually impressed by Facebook here.

The packaging is divine â€”almost Apple-like, the product is well-designed, and the onboarding was delightful.

Although, the games and content were pretty sparse.

I haven't used their blue app in years, and [Instagram is on it's way out too](https://patwalls.com/rip-instagram).

I've just started my Oculus journey (Wearing it feels like the future!)

Looking forward to see what they do next.
