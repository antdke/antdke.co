On Christmas Eve, I made [a bet](https://antdke.co/posts/small-bets) with myself.

The bet was to write everyday for the next 6 months.

And, for the past 7 days, I've done just that. I written and published 10 blog posts (including this one).

To make it "official", I'm making it a 2021 goal.

In 2021, I will write a blog post every day.

# FAQs

**1. Do you have a plan for what you'll write?**

No plan. Whatever comes to mind :) Could be about [product strategy](https://antdke.co/posts/microcopy), giving [advice](https://antdke.co/posts/uncertainty) to myself, or just [what I had for breakfast](https://antdke.co/posts/blueberry-pancakes). Literally anything.

**2. Why do this?**

Because I want to:

- grow peopleâ€™s trust in my character
- get all my good ideas out into the world
- get all my shitty ideas out of my head
- strengthen my creating/shipping muscles
- connect with more like-minded people
- get over my fear of publishing (rejection)
