For the past few days, I haven't been eating the best.

For example, last night I ate like 2 bars of [these chocolates](https://tonyschocolonely.com/us/en).

<br />

My boss recommended them. It's actually like crack.

(Approach with extreme caution)

So, I'm fighting temptation and going back to [my healthy eating habits](https://antdke.co/posts/eat-your-greens).

**Step 1:** Not eating chocolate at midnight.

I still have 1 bar in the fridge.

Wish me luck.
