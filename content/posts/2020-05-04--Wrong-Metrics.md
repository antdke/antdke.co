Yesterday, I gained 100 Twitter followers.

What also happened yesterday: A girl I was seeing told me we should "just be friends".

So...was it a good day or a bad day?

# The Wrong Metrics

I want this post to be a reminder to myself: be careful what your goals are.

Since the start of quarantine, I’ve been optimizing for work.

“Grow my audience. Build products. Become a better entrepreneur. ” Those were my goals.

And that I did.

I built a killer team. We launched [a cool app](https://chatparty.co) in 15 days. It was used by hundreds of people. Featured in [publications](https://thehustle.co/04212020-silicon-valley-clubhouse/). And we’re currently [pivoting to something cooler](https://antdke.co/posts/building-hinote).

And I’ve been gaining lots more [newsletters subscribers](https://twitter.com/antdke/status/1254443185604001799?s=20) and [twitter followers](https://twitter.com) along the way.

But you know what I wasn’t doing?

I wasn’t responding to her texts. I wasn’t having quality conversations with her. I wasn’t treating her like someone I wanted to have in my life.

Frankly, I kinda took her granted.

We aren't exactly an item. (It’s complicated) But, I definitely wasn’t acting like I wanted to be.

I over-optimized for the wrong metrics.

Time spent doing one thing is time not spent doing something else.

We tend to wish for things to happen to us without taking into account, what the [the second order effects](https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/) will be.

I’ve become a better entrepreneur in the past month. But at what cost?

Is this a sign of a pattern that could haunt my relationships in the future? Am I overreacting?

Idk.

What I do know is I have some lost time to make up for. I’m gonna start FaceTiming her more often.

We’ll start there. Wish me luck.

# Outro

It’s like that old adage and Grammy winning song by [The Pussycat Dolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pussycat_Dolls).

_“Be careful what you wish for, 'Cause you just might get it.”_
