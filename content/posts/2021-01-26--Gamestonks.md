So, [GameStop's stock (\$GME)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME) is up over 1,600% in the past 3 months. It's up over 450% in the past week alone.

And, apparently this is mostly due to one guy rallying many people on [the subreddit r/wallstreetbets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) to buy and hold the stock with him.

And, the guy who started [the original reddit meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5nphz/gme_yolo_update_jan_26_2021/) has turned his $50k investment into $21.95 million.

We live in wild times.
