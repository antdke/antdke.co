Today, I had to give a UX research presentation to my boss.

The meeting was at 6:05pm and I didn’t have enough time to create presentation visuals using the research I spent all day doing.

Luckily, throughout the day, I had written down all my thoughts, my rationale, and my decisions regarding my research in Apple Notes.

So I was prepared, but I didn’t have a fancy slide deck to show.

Nonetheless, 6:05 came and it was time to present my findings.

I screen shared and showed loose screenshots that I took of UI designs and I used my notes as a script as I was talking through my findings and product decisions.

It went _brilliantly_.

My rationale was clear. My research was comprehensive. And my “presentation” was received with praise.

My writing structured all my thoughts so crystal-clear that it made a slide-deck unnecessary.

Who needs pictures, when you have words?
