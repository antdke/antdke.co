Life has been great lately.

I’m making good money at [my day job](https://blissfully.com).

I’m aggressively long-term investing into the S&P 500.

I’ve even started [art investing](https://antdke.co/posts/today-i-became-an-art-investor) —to diversify into an uncorrelated asset.

Right now is the most financially secure I’ve ever been in my life.

And as far as mental health goes, I feel:

- less stressed
- [less envious](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1353002208200175617?s=20)
- less anxious
- less fearful
- more calm
- more happy
- more excited about the future

Having money in the bank is one of the best things for your mental health.

It does wonders.
