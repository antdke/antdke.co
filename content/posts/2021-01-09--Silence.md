I've been on Twitter a lot less lately.

Something about needing peace.

Twitter is like a fire-hose of information.

## The Spectrum

On a spectrum of "life-changing information" to "why do I need to know this?", Twitter has it all.

There are times where I could find a thread on startups and learn something super useful that'll help me in the long run.

But it's usually empty scrolling.

Twitter is great at give you lots of "okay" informationâ€”stuff that's generally useful but you might not need right now...or ever really.

There's _too much_ okay information.

It all just becomes <span style="color:red">noise</span>.

## Mental Real Estate

And I know personally, I have a limited real estate for things my mind can handle in a day. And I'd rather fill it with the most essential things: family, my girlfriend, work, my personal projects.

Twitter, or any non-essential thing for that matter, requires mental real estate.

And lately, I've been pretty unforgiving to anything that wants to encroach on my mental real estate that I haven't given permission to.

As I write that, I think of an old man yelling from his porch, "Give off my lawn."

But realistically, I think my lawn has 80 ft walls surrounding it and I have a moat with crocodiles and sharks that requires a drawbridge to get across.

No one's getting a piece of my real estate without my permission.

Nowadays, I just much prefer silence over noise.

(P.S. I'll probably expand on this idea in a more poetic, concise way later but for now these are my raw thoughts)
