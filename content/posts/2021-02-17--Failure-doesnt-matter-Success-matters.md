I came across a quote and had this thought:

Aim to fail 1,000 times until you succeed.

Put little importance on failing. It’s just a byproduct of getting to success.

Miss a jumpshot? [Shoot until you make it](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/42/b8/2542b8a10223743edc4a7e95bbd9649e.jpg).

If you can train your brain to not react too negatively to failing, then you’ll get everything you want out of life.

Fail, forget, and then keep moving forward.
