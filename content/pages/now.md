Since the start of **2020**, I've been...

- 💎 Teaching myself [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) to build a Saas product.

- 🛠️ Growing a community around [learning product skills](http://theproductperson.com) —Up to 4,000 people at time of writing this!

- 🧘 Practicing gratitude & mindfulness

Currently, challenging myself to make \$500 by Spring Break (March 13) so I can go to Miami with friends 🌴

If you [have a generous heart](https://www.patreon.com/antdke), it will be much appreciated 🤗
