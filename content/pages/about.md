## Half-baked bio

**Got into tech and startups at 16.** I helped with a friend's startup. Then I found **Garyvee** and startup videos on YouTube. Then I found **Naval** and tech twitter. Then I got into **indie hacking**. Now I'm here. (I might make a more in-depth bio later on, we'll see)

I love **geeking about products** & **building businesses**.

No part-time job. **Doing what I love.**

My end goal is **generational wealth**.

These days, I mostly code, [read](/pages/reading), [write](/), bike through New York City, and design products.
